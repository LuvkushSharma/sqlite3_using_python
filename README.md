# Sqlite3_Using_Python

Steps to run the files :-

1. Firstly you have to Open the Command Prompt if you are in window.
2. Then, change the current directory to the directory/Folder in which you are going to code the sqlite.
   Ex : 
   Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22621.819]           |
   (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.      |-----> Initially on the Command Prompt
                                                        |
   C:\Users\XYZ>                                        |
   
   
   ---> Let's say you are going to save your python files in the folder : SQLITE
        Then write :    cd SQLITE_FOLDER_PATH
   
   Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22621.819]
   (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   C:\Users\XYZ> cd C:\Users\XYZ\Desktop\DBMS\SQLITE
   
   C:\Users\XYZ\Desktop\DBMS\SQLITE>
   
   
 3. After , changing the directorry just write : python file_name.py
    
    Ex :
    C:\Users\XYZ\Desktop\DBMS\SQLITE> python Table_Creation_1.py    ----------> To run the file
    
 So, after writing python file_name.py you will get the desired output.
